# heart-disease-diagnosis
Machine Learning project to evaluate heart diease diagnosis. I have also used data visualization techniques such as scatter plot to visualize the data. Dataset used is taken from https://towardsdatascience.com/heart-disease-prediction-in-tensorflow-2-tensorflow-for-hackers-part-ii-378eef0400ee .I have used the SVM model to generate the model and got almost 84% accuracy.
